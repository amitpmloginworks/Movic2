      <p style="font-size:20px;" text-center><b>THE CHALLENGES</b></p><br>
      <p> TMDB is an open source website with no official application or responsive website.
         Many companies generally rely on the use of TMDB API interface, but it was not our cup of tea. 
        We were actually looking for a user-friendly application with better intuitive, UX and functionality. </p>
